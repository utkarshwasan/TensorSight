### **An AI-Powered Real-Time Image Recognition System**

Welcome to **TensorSight**, a cutting-edge **AI-powered image recognition system** that classifies objects in real time from live video streams. Built with **Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV**, this project delivers a powerful and user-friendly solution for real-time computer vision applications. The system features a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and is deployed with a modern, responsive web interface using Gradio.

## **üîç Problem Statement**
- **Manual visual identification is slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error**‚Äîparticularly in environments where timely and precise recognition is crucial, such as robotics, supply chains, education, and automated systems.
- **Traditional solutions are often restricted by cost, technical barriers, or lack modern, interactive interfaces,** limiting their deployment and accessibility.

## **üí° Our Solution**
- **TensorSight transforms any internet-connected device with a camera into a powerful AI visual recognition tool**, delivering accurate, real-time classification results through a seamless Gradio-powered web interface.
- **Supports both live camera input and still image uploads,** providing instant predictions with confidence scores and detailed analytics, all within a visually appealing, user-friendly experience.
- **Real-world applications:** Streamlines automation in smart facilities, supports rapid inventory and quality control, enhances e-learning environments, and opens new possibilities for AI-powered visual workflows in research and industry.

## **üöÄ Key Features**
- **Lightning-Fast AI Object Recognition:** Delivers live, interactive predictions for 36 unique object classes in under a second, including transparent top-3 result breakdowns.
- **Custom Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes robust CNNs, data augmentation, and systematic hyperparameter optimization to achieve validation accuracy up to 83%‚Äîstriking a balance between speed and reliability.
- **Modern, Accessible Web App:** Developed with Gradio for a sleek, no-setup-required gateway, featuring upload/browse controls and instant feedback, accessible to users of all backgrounds.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**
- **Python, TensorFlow** ‚Äì Chosen for cutting-edge model training, scalability, and ease of implementation.
- **OpenCV** ‚Äì Empowers real-time image capture and efficient pre-processing.
- **Gradio** ‚Äì Simplifies deployment as a modern web interface, removing the barriers of traditional app development.
- **NumPy, PIL** ‚Äì Streamline numerical computation and image processing for fast, reliable predictions.

## **üìà Impact & Benefits**
- **Reduces visual task durations from minutes to milliseconds,** slashing overhead and accelerating feedback loops.
- **Minimizes human subjectivity and error** via AI, with consistent, quantifiable accuracy‚Äîvalidated at 83% across challenging benchmarks.
- **Designed for easy adaptation,** enabling users to expand to new classes or datasets and integrate into broader intelligent systems.
